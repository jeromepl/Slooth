        <h1>About Slooth</h1>
        <p>To use Slooth, simply click "Record New Macro" and Slooth will start recording all your actions <b>after the first redirect</b> that occurs.<br>
        Once you click "Stop Recording", you will be prompted to enter a name for the new macro.</p>
        <p><b style="color: red;">Note</b> that Slooth currently does not work very well with websites that load asynchronously as it attempts to run the recorded actions as fast as possible.</p>
        <p>Slooth was initially built by a team of 4 at the 2016 McHacks hackathon where it placed first!</p>
        <p>Contribute to Slooth on the project's <a href="https://github.com/jeromepl/Slooth" target="_blank">github page</a>.</p>
